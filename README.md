# Module-11-Challenge-Soup-

In this Challenge I have been assigned to utilize the features of Beaututiful Soup to scrape a website and analyze data provided on a collection of Martian weather data. All materials are located within the Starter Code folder. Part 1 consists of the inital scrape of the provided website showing how to successfully utilize the Developer Tools to reproduce the names of the articles as well as the preview of what the artciles include. Part 2 scrapes a table of Martian Weather Data to answer the following questions:
How many months exist on Mars?
How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
  -Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
  -Plot the results as a bar chart.
Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
  -Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
  -Plot the results as a bar chart.
About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
  -Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
  -Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

A CSV created to store the tables data is found in the DataFrame folder.
